## Description

GraphGrabber is a JLR tool which formats PDF reports into a PowerPoint style. It does this by converting PDFs to images then cropping them. The resultant image is then added to a slide alongside other images found in the PDF.

The report definitions are hardcoded for now and will remain that way unless there is a user need to build new functions for cropping and placing images.

Currently supports VT-01 (2 images), VT-07 (7 images), VT-12 (2 or 4 images), VT-15 (3 or 6 images)
